This is an implementation of a facial keypoint detector.

After forking, create a directory folder at the same level as src. Within this directory, create 5 new directories:
1. detector: Download frontal face as haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml from http://alereimondo.no-ip.org/OpenCV/34/
and insert it here
2. images: Download an image of two faces (e.g. of the Obamas) and place it here as obamas.jpg
3. saved_models: Keep this empty for now
4. train-test-data: Data should be downloaded from https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~wolf/ytfaces/, and placed in
these directories:
    a. Test images: 'train-test-data/test'
    b. Training images: 'train-test-data/training'
    c. Test image keypoints as test_frames_keypoints.csv: 'train-test-data'
    d. Training image keypoints as training_frames_keypoints.csv: 'train-test-data'
5. transformed_data: Keep this empty for now

Now run the files in this order:
1. data_preparation.py: To prepare the data
2. network_architecture.py: To train the facial keypoint detector
3. model_visualization.py: To test the facial keypoint detection algorithm and visualize on some images
